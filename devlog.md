### 2024-10-7 - 1.5 hrs: 3d movement basics
* resolved a merge conflight with the comment planning
* followed one tutorial for grid based movement but decided against it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tDcJEbQnW0&list=PL1VENaIqLopxeHHpqYY1nDQ3Erm37exLb&index=12&pp=gAQBiAQB
* somewhat followed a tutorial for grid based movement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u1Dq6h7sGU
* coded logic for moving around in a grid
* right now the character moves way too fast, and horizontal movement is still tied to a grid which isn't ideal
* used chatgpt to fix a bug where you could only use once then never again because of the way the is_moving variable was handled

### 2024-10-1 - 2 hr: comment prototypes
* began making a comment prototype of the character movement
* this just has explainations what what logic needs to be where
* planning out how tracking what lane the characters are in will work
* started planning out how the game loop will handle character directions
* spent a lot of time trying to get git and godot to work nicely together
*   had to fix an issue where main had the assets folder but a branch didn't for some reason

### 2024-09-24 - 2 hr: Setting Up the Project
* uploaded that build to itch.io
* created a mostly blank build from the project
* created a godot project
* created the devlog
* created a trello board and added tasks
* uploaded my proposal to git
